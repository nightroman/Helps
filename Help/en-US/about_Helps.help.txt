SHORT DESCRIPTION
    PowerShell XML help builder

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The module provides functions for building PowerShell XML help files from
    help scripts and for creating help script templates for existing objects.
    Help can be created for everything that supports XML help: cmdlets,
    providers, scripts, and functions in scripts or modules.

    Help scripts are almost WYSIWYG, they look very similar to the result help.
    Still, they are PowerShell scripts and this makes a lot of useful features
    easy. One of them is building localized help files.

    On dot-sourcing the script provides the following functions:

    Convert-Helps
        Converts help source scripts into the PowerShell MAML help file.

    Merge-Helps
        Used to derive help of derived cmdlets from help of base cmdlets.

    New-Helps
        Creates help and localized data templates for commands and providers.

    Test-Helps
        Tests help example code snippets with built-in test script blocks.

    HELP SCRIPT

    The help source script returns hashtables describing command/provider help.
    The caller or the script itself should make all the commands available.

    Synopsis, description, remarks, etc. texts can be strings or string arrays.

    Each string is shown as a new line. Strings with leading tabs or spaces are
    treated as pre-formatted blocks. Other strings are formatted: sequences of
    not empty not indented lines are joined together with single spaces.

    COMMAND HELP TABLE

    Mandatory keys
        command, synopsis.

    description
        The default value is the synopsis text.

    sets
        Keys are parameter set names, values are remarks.

    parameters
        Keys are parameter names, values are remarks or hashtables.
        Example:
            Param1 = 'Description 1.'
            Param2 = @{
                description = 'Description of parameter 2.'
                default = 'Default value 2.'
                wildcard = $true
                required = $true
            }

    examples ... title
        The default is generated as --- EXAMPLE N ---.

    examples ... code
        It is [ScriptBlock] or [string].
        [ScriptBlock] is called by 'test' called by Test-Helps.

    examples ... test
        It is [ScriptBlock].
        $args[0] is the example code being tested.

    PROVIDER HELP TABLE

    Provider help items are similar to command help items with same names.
    There are a few differences:

    Mandatory keys
        provider, synopsis.

    examples
        introduction and code are not joined as they are for commands.
